# APEX Low Test Framework

The goal of the project is to create an Automated Low Test Framework for APEX applications that will allow users with no experience to write and execute automated tests using human-readable language. We have created a dictionary of predefined English phrases that can be used to specify requirements. The same predefined phrases can be used to automatically run tests by our framework. With the low-test approach, anyone who can write an English description of the requirements can write automated tests executed against an APEX application. To get a taste of what we're talking about, see the following example of a low-test requirements (and test cases) specification:

```
Scenario: User log-in and access Activities page
    Given the user access the 'https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/dataconsulting/r/customers/login' url
    And user entered 'demo' in 'Username' field
    And user entered 'demo_password' in 'Password' field
    And user clicked on the 'Sign In' button
    Then user navigates to 'Activities' page
```

Our framework can take above desciption and run test case automaticaly.
